h2. Summary

A cruel mistress that uses the public suffix domain list to dominate URLs by canonicalizing, finding public suffixes, and breaking them into their domain parts.

h2. Description

This simple library can parse a URL into its canonical form. It uses the list of domains from "http://publicsuffix.org":http://publicsuffix.org to break the domain into its public suffix, domain, and subdomain.
